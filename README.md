# Employee Management System (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

A modular and extensible Employee Management REST API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  
Designed for HR teams or developers as a backend template for managing employees, attendance, payroll, and more.  
The codebase follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture for clean separation of concerns.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Employee CRUD:** Add, view, update, and delete employees
- **Attendance Management:** Track employee attendance status
- **Modular MVC Structure:** Clean separation of routes, controllers, and models
- **MongoDB Integration:** Data persistence with Mongoose ODM
- **RESTful API:** Standardized endpoints for integration
- **Environment Config:** Secure sensitive data using dotenv
- **Easy to Extend:** Add Payroll, Departments, Authentication, etc.

### Folder Explanations

- **controllers/** – Functions that handle API logic (called by routes).
- **models/** – MongoDB data models defined using Mongoose.
- **routes/** – Maps HTTP requests to controller functions.
- **middleware/** – Custom Express middlewares (auth, etc).
- **services/** – (Optional) Put shared business logic here.
- **utils/** – (Optional) Utility helpers for DRY code.
- **app.js** – App startup, connects DB, loads routes/middlewares.

## 📦 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or Atlas cloud)
- Git

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

**Step-by-step commands:**

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Employee-management.git
    cd Employee-management
    ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create Environment Variables**
    - In the root folder, create a file called `.env`  
    - Add the following content (customize as needed):

      ```
      MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/employee-management
      JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
      PORT=5000
      ```

4. **Run MongoDB Locally**  
   If not running already, start MongoDB:
    ```bash
    mongod
    ```

5. **Start the Server (Development)**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

| GET    | /api/employees         | Get all employees              |
| GET    | /api/employees/:id     | Get employee by ID             |
| POST   | /api/employees         | Create new employee            |
| PUT    | /api/employees/:id     | Update employee by ID          |
| DELETE | /api/employees/:id     | Delete employee by ID          |
| GET    | /api/employees/test    | Test route (check server)      |
| GET    | /api/attendance        | Get all attendance records     |
| ...    | ...                    | (Add more routes as needed)    |

## 💡 Extending the Project

- **Add More Modules:** Create new models, controllers, and routes (e.g., Payroll, Departments, Authentication).
- **Implement Authentication:** Secure endpoints with JWT middleware.
- **Frontend Integration:** Connect with React, Angular, Vue, or mobile app.

---

## ⚠️ Environment & Security

- **Never commit `.env` to GitHub.**
- Sensitive info (like DB URI, JWT secrets) goes in `.env`.
